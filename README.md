Quote Generator

This was a fun first project because it taught me a lot about myself and what I can improve on.
•	Learned to use Visual Studio Code environment to connect my HTML,CSS and JS files together and load a web page 
•	Discovered version control and how to use Git and GitHub to aid in the debugging process
•	I failed to completely remove all errors, but I learned the value in searching for code documentation
•	First time building a dynamic app that retrieves data from another source
•	Fascinated by the simple fact that I can use the quote generator to post on twitter
•	After the project, I realized I need to focus on optimizing my code for faster load times
•	In the future, I want to improve user experience by including a feature to save quotes
